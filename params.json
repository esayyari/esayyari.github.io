{"name":"DISTIQUE","tagline":"DISTIQUE by Erfan Sayyari","body":"### DISTIQUE\r\nDISTIQUE is a python based tool to infer species trees from gene trees. It is a forced acronym for Distance-based Inference of Species Trees using Induced Quartet Elements. The draft paper is available at [paper](), and the supplementary material available at [supplementary]().\r\n\r\n\r\nIts basic idea is to infer the species tree from gene trees by computing a distance between two species from the set of quartets that include the two species. We have found ways to do this in a statistically consistent manner and are exploring ways to make this run in quadratic running time.   \r\n\r\n### How DISTIQUE infers species trees\r\nIt first finds a distance matrix based on the gene trees' quartets, and then infers the species trees using a distance-based method like FASTME or PhyD*.\r\n\r\n### How to install DISTIQUE\r\nYou could install DISTIQUE in a couple of steps:  \r\n1. Clone to [DISTIQUE git repository](https://github.com/esayyari/DISTIQUE) or download  [this zip file]().   \r\n2. Then you need to set environmental variable WS_HOME to the directory under which this \"DISTIQUE\" repository is placed \r\n3. There are a couple of dependencies that you need to install at this step as well. \r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n1. FASTME 2.0 is now available at [this link] (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/fastme/binaries.php). [FASTME] (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/fastme/binaries.php) is a distance based method that produces species trees based on the provided distance matrix. Put it under your WS_HOME. \r\n2. PhyD* is another distance based method that could handle missing values in distance matrix reasonably. You could download it from [this link] (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyd/binaries.php). Then put it under you WS_HOME.  \r\n3. Quartet code from [this thesis](http://jensjohansen.com/thesis/). Make sure that you set the QUARTETS flag to \"1\" for compiling it. After compilation put the executable code quart_bin under DISTIQUE/bin.   \r\n4. The set of tools at [this git repository] (https://github.com/smirarab/global). They are written in different languages, but installing it is supper easy.  \r\n5. DendroPy 4.0.3, which is a Python library for phylogenetic computing.\r\n\r\n### How DISTIQUE works\r\nThe main file to use DISTIQUE is available under DISTIQUE/src/utils/distique.py  \r\n\r\nUsage: python distique.py \\[-h (show help)\\] \\[-f FILENAME\\] \\[-g GT (read gene trees from GT)\\] \\[-o OUT (working directory)\\] \\[-t THR (min majority consensus threshold, default is 0.5)\\] \\[-m METHOD (The method to compute the distance of taxa. The default is prod)\\] \\[ -v VERBOSE\\]  \r\n\r\n### Datasets\r\nThere are mainly three datasets that we used in this paper.  \r\n1. [11-taxon dataset] (). This dataset contains gene trees, and true species trees  \r\n2. [avian dataset] (). This dataset contains estimated gene trees, true gene trees, and true species tree  \r\n3. [mammalian dataset] (). This dataset contains true gene trees, estimated gene trees and true species tree  \r\n\r\n### Biological dataset\r\nWe reanalyze the avian biological dataset of ED Jarvis et. al. available at paper:  \r\nJarvis, Erich D., et. al. \"Phylogenomic analyses data of the avian phylogenomics project.\" GigaScience 4.1 (2015): 1-9.\r\n\r\n### Spieces trees\r\nWe now publish the species trees inferred using the following methods. For more information look at [draft paper]().  \r\n1. [DISTIQUE-AAD] ()  \r\n2. [DISTIQUE-AMD] ()  \r\n2. [ASTRID (NJst)] ()  \r\n3. [ASTRAL] ()  \r\n4. [RAxML] ()  \r\n\r\n### Report bugs\r\ncontact @esayyari (esayyari@eng.ucsd.edu).\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
